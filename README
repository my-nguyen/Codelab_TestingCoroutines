Advanced Android in Kotlin 05.3:Testing Coroutines and Jetpack integrations

https://developer.android.com/codelabs/advanced-android-kotlin-training-testing-survey#0

I give up at the end of Step 5: "Task: Testing Coroutine Timing"

in Step 4 (Task: Coroutines and ViewModels), I couldn't get MainCoroutineRule to implement or
inherit from TestCoroutineScope by TestCoroutineScope(dispatcher) because TestCoroutineScope is
deprecated and I can't figure out what to replace it with. As a result, the test function
getTasks_requestsAllTasksFromRemoteDataSource gives compiler error when switching from "runTest" to
"mainCoroutineRule.runTest" in DefaultTasksRepositoryTest

in Step 5, the test function loadTasks_loading in StatisticsViewModelTest also fails because of the
same reason as above, and as a result, mainCoroutineRule.pauseDispatcher() and
mainCoroutineRule.resumeDispatcher() give compiler error.
